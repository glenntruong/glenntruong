- 👋 Hi, I’m Glenn
- :art: At the present time, I'm working as a front-end developer with mostly ReactJS, Angular and NodeJS. In addition, VueJS is also part of my front-end framework experience, however, my familiarity in it is not as deep as the two others aforementioned.
- 👀 I’m interested in techologies, travelling to the places that I've never been, reading books, learning new things, and acquiring new knowledges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some new technologies and skills in new languages. Besides, I'm taking up Hangul as my new favorite foreign language. ^^
- 📫 Contact me through this email :)
